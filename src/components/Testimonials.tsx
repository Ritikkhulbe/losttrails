      "I joined the Filmmaking Retreat in Himachal without knowing what to expect  and it turned out to be the most creatively fulfilling trip I've had. The group was small and everyone was so passionate. From brainstorming to shooting in the middle of pine forests, every day felt like a scene from a film. Legends of Lost Trails was such a fun and unexpected highlight. It felt like a close-knit film camp in the mountains.",

      "What stood out for me was how immersive everything was. We weren't just handed cameras and asked to shoot  we were guided, challenged, and pushed to go deeper with our stories. The group dynamic was great and the hosts made sure no one felt left out. And yes, Legends of Lost Trails was a mad storytelling ride  probably my favourite part!",
